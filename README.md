# Quick_Sort
Quick sort is a algorithm which works on divide and conquer strategy. We work with recursion in Quick Sort algorithm. In each and every iteration we position pivot at its correct position such that elements to its left are lesser than the pivot and that to the right are larger than that of pivot element. Pivot element can be any element from the array, it can be the first element, the last element or any random element but we have considered rightmost element as the pivot element .Quick sort doesn't create any extra or temporary variable thus it significantly reduces the space complexity. But when it comes to time complexity in worst case i.e if the input array is sorted either ascending or descending then it would take O( n^2 ) time. The best time complexity would arise if in each case the pivot element divides the array in two equal parts, the time complexity for this case would be O(nLogn). If we need to sort the array in descending order using quicksort we just need to invert the comparision condition in while loop in partition function.
